# UWB-dataset-for-industrial-self-calibration

_(Note as our associated paper is under review, we will only disclose the datasets after publication)_

This repository contains open UWB localization datasets, captured in industrial environments and is published by IDLab - Ghent University - imec. The dataset is captured in-house, at iGent, Zwijnaarde, Belgium [1].

More information about the environments, data capture strategy and results can be found in our publication [2].

When using these datasets for future publications, please refer to [2].

I'm happy to answer any questions about this dataset at ben.vanherbruggen@ugent.be
