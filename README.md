# UWB-dataset-for-industrial-self-calibration

_(The datasets are available upon request by ben.vanherbruggen@ugent.be)_

This repository contains open UWB localization datasets, captured in industrial environments and is published by IDLab - Ghent University - imec. The dataset is captured in-house, at iGent, Zwijnaarde, Belgium [1]. The detailed structure can be found below.

Details about the environment, data capture strategy and results can be found in our publication [2]. When using these datasets for future publications, please refer to [2].

I'm happy to answer any questions about this dataset at ben.vanherbruggen@ugent.be
